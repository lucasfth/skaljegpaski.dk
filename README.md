# Skal jeg på ski?

A tiny, single-page site that answers "Should I go skiing?" and shows a countdown to the selected ski date.

## Features

Can show if you should go skiing based on:

1. That you of course want to go skiing.
2. Your friends want to go skiing.
3. The weather is good for skiing.

Based on these conditions it will show a "Yes!" or "No." answer.

Also has a countdown timer to the ski date, which gets stored as URL parameters so you can share it with friends.
